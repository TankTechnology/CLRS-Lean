# CLRS Section 13.1 - Red-black trees

This section starts the red-black-tree development with local invariants and
rotation facts.  It does not yet formalize the full insertion or deletion
algorithms.  Instead it proves reusable lemmas that those algorithms will need:
rotations preserve membership, repainting the root black preserves the no-red-red
property, and repainting the root preserves child black-height balance.

Main results:

- Theorem {lit}`RBTree.inTree_rotateLeft_iff`: left rotation preserves tree
  membership.
- Theorem {lit}`RBTree.inTree_rotateRight_iff`: right rotation preserves tree
  membership.
- Theorem {lit}`RBTree.noRedRed_repaint_black`: repainting the root black
  preserves the no-red-red invariant.
- Theorem {lit}`RBTree.balancedBlackHeight_repaintRoot`: repainting the root
  preserves balanced child black heights.

Current gaps:

- The executable CLRS {lit}`RB-INSERT`, {lit}`RB-INSERT-FIXUP`,
  {lit}`RB-DELETE`, and {lit}`RB-DELETE-FIXUP` algorithms remain future work.
