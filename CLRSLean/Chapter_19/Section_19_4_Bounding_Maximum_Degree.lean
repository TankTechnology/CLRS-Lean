# CLRS Section 19.4 - Bounding the maximum degree

This section proves the combinatorial heart of the Fibonacci-heap analysis:
a node of degree `d` roots a subtree of at least `F(d+2)` nodes, hence the
maximum degree in an `n`-node heap is `O(log n)` and, sharply,
`D(n) ≤ ⌊log_φ n⌋` where `φ = (1 + √5)/2`.  This is CLRS Lemma 19.1, Lemma 19.4
and Lemma 19.5 (Section 19.4).

We work over an abstract rooted-tree model.  A Fibonacci-heap tree is a node
carrying an ordered list of child subtrees.  The invariant maintained by
`CONSOLIDATE` (equal-degree linking) and cascading cuts is captured by
{lit}`CLRS.Chapter19.FTree.Wellformed`: if the children of a node are listed in
the order they were linked, then the child in position `j` has degree at least
`j - 1`.  This is exactly CLRS Lemma 19.1 (a child linked when its parent had
degree `j` itself had degree `j` at link time, and the "at most one child lost"
mark invariant lets it drop to `j - 1`).

Main results:

- {lit}`CLRS.Chapter19.FTree.Wellformed`: the CLRS Lemma 19.1 marked-tree
  invariant ("at most one child lost").
- {lit}`CLRS.Chapter19.FTree.wellformed_size_ge_fibLowerBound`: **CLRS Lemma
  19.4** — a wellformed node of degree `d` has subtree size at least
  `F(d+2)` (`fibLowerBound d`).
- {lit}`CLRS.Chapter19.FTree.goldenRatio_pow_le_fibLowerBound`: `φ^d ≤ F(d+2)`.
- {lit}`CLRS.Chapter19.FTree.wellformed_goldenRatio_pow_le_size`: `φ^d ≤ size`.
- {lit}`CLRS.Chapter19.FTree.wellformed_degree_le_logb`: **CLRS Lemma 19.5** —
  a wellformed node of degree `d` in an `n`-node heap satisfies
  `d ≤ log_φ n`.
- {lit}`CLRS.Chapter19.FTree.wellformed_degree_le_floor_logb`: the sharp CLRS
  form `d ≤ ⌊log_φ n⌋`.
- {lit}`CLRS.Chapter19.FTree.wellformed_degree_le_twice_log_two`: the coarse
  natural-number budget `d ≤ 2 · ⌊log₂ n⌋ + 1`.

Current gaps:

- The executable pointer forest, the destructive `CONSOLIDATE` and cascading-cut
  procedures, and the amortized-cost accounting remain future refinement
  targets.  This file seals the structural degree bound they rely on.

Notation conventions used in this section:

- `t` : a rooted Fibonacci-heap tree
- `d`, `k` : node degree (number of children)
- `F(d+2)` : the `(d+2)`-nd Fibonacci number, here {lit}`fibLowerBound d`
- `φ` : the golden ratio `(1 + √5)/2`

The marked-tree invariant of CLRS Lemma 19.1.  A node is `Wellformed` when its
children, listed in the order they were linked (earliest first), satisfy the
degree bound: the child in position `j` has degree at least `j - 1`, and every
child is itself `Wellformed`.

This is exactly the invariant that `CONSOLIDATE` and cascading cuts maintain: a
child linked while its parent had degree `j` itself had degree `j` at link
time, and the "at most one child lost before a cut" mark rule lets it drop to at
most `j - 1`.

Numeric core of CLRS Lemma 19.4, generalized over a starting position `p`.

If a list `L` of subtree sizes has, in position `j`, a value at least
`F((p + j) + 1)` (`fibLowerBound (p + j - 1)`, the Lemma-19.1 degree lower bound
for a child starting at offset `p`), then the whole list plus the ambient node
weighs at least `F(p + |L| + 2)` more than `F(p + 2)`:
`fibLowerBound (p + L.length) ≤ fibLowerBound p + L.sum`.

The proof peels the head child and shifts the offset by one, using
{lit}`fibLowerBound_succ_le` to fold the head's contribution into the Fibonacci
recurrence.

**CLRS Lemma 19.4.**  Any wellformed node of degree `d` roots a subtree of at
least `F(d + 2)` nodes: `fibLowerBound d ≤ size`.

The proof is a strong (well-founded) induction on the tree.  Each child `cs[j]`
has, by the Lemma-19.1 invariant, degree at least `j - 1`, so by the inductive
hypothesis and monotonicity of `fibLowerBound` its subtree has at least
`fibLowerBound (j - 1)` nodes.  Summing those bounds through
{lit}`sum_lb_from` gives `fibLowerBound (degree) ≤ size`.

## The invariant is maintained by linking, and is tight

The `Wellformed` invariant is exactly what `CONSOLIDATE`'s equal-degree link step
preserves, and the `F(d + 2)` bound is achieved, so the model is non-vacuous and
the analysis is sharp.

**Invariant maintenance (CLRS Lemma 19.1 preservation).**  Appending a new child
`y` to the end of a wellformed node's child list preserves wellformedness,
provided `y`'s degree is at least `(current degree) - 1`.

This is precisely the structural step performed by `CONSOLIDATE`: a new child is
attached in the last (most recent) link position, and it satisfies the position
`j = |xs|` requirement `j - 1 ≤ y.degree` exactly because equal-degree roots are
linked.
