# Chapter 34 Cook--Levin Generator Attack

Date: 2026-08-14

## Exact Remaining Theorem Boundary

The semantic Cook--Levin construction and the target-language verifier are
closed. The remaining main-theorem boundary is the concrete machine-level
implementation of

```lean
fun x => encodeCircuit (Turing.CookLevin.verifierCircuit W x)
```

followed by the existing semantic bridge to `GeneralCircuitSAT`. Completion
requires all of the following public declarations, with no placeholder or
project axiom:

- `Turing.CookLevin.verifierCircuitProgram`;
- `Turing.CookLevin.verifierCircuitProgram_outputs`;
- `Turing.CookLevin.verifierCircuitTime`;
- `Turing.CookLevin.verifierCircuitSteps_le`;
- `Turing.CookLevin.verifierCircuitComputableInPolyTime`;
- `Turing.CookLevin.polyTimeVerifiable_reducible_to_generalCircuitSAT`;
- `generalCircuitSAT_npHard` and `generalCircuitSAT_npComplete`.

The interface was run in RED before implementation. The failures were exactly
these missing generator/reduction declarations; the already completed
Cook--Levin semantics and `GeneralCircuitSAT ∈ NP` declarations remained green.

## Foundation Closed in This Attack

`PolyBuilder.Clock` supplies the missing arbitrary-degree clock layer:

- `unitClock_computableInPolyTime` implements the linear clock;
- `squareUnitClock_computableInPolyTime` implements one concrete quadratic
  expansion;
- `iteratedSquareClock_computableInPolyTime d` composes these machines and
  produces exactly `n ^ (2 ^ d)` unit tokens;
- `polynomial_eval_le_polynomialClock_length` proves that the clock derived
  from any fixed `Polynomial Nat` dominates its value on nonempty inputs;
- `polynomialClock_computableInPolyTime` packages that dominating clock as a
  concrete polynomial-time TM2.

The empty input is deliberately not hidden in the domination lemma. The final
generator must handle it by a separate finite-control branch, where its output
is a fixed circuit encoding.

## Accepted Construction Route

The generator will be a streaming TM2 whose finite control embeds only data
from the fixed verifier `W`. Runtime-sized values remain unary counters or
bounded stack data. The implementation phases are:

1. preserve and scan the public input while constructing polynomial clocks for
   the certificate, horizon, height, and gate-index envelopes;
2. stream tableau-input gates, the shared Boolean pool, row-validity gates,
   transition gates, and the three boundary families in the same order as the
   existing `CircuitBuilder` construction;
3. maintain the current gate index in unary and serialize every predecessor
   reference directly in the established `CircuitSym` wire format;
4. stream the final conjunction and output marker;
5. prove one output theorem per phase and compose them into exact equality with
   `encodeCircuit (verifierCircuit W x)`;
6. package the polynomial runtime, universal reduction, NP-hardness, and
   NP-completeness wrappers.

The next smallest missing reusable primitive is an input-preserving phase
runner with a unary index emitter. The polynomial clock alone is not treated
as a generator: it supplies the required iteration budget but does not know
the circuit-symbol template at each position.

## Known Failed or Rejected Routes

1. **Deriving computation from output length.** A polynomial output-size
   theorem does not imply polynomial-time computability, or even computability
   for an arbitrary function.
2. **A membership-selected constant circuit.** Selecting `true` or `false`
   from `x ∈ L` is noncomputable and is not the Cook--Levin construction.
3. **Putting the generator into `VerifierWitness`.** This merely assumes the
   theorem that Cook--Levin must prove and makes the reduction circular.
4. **Weakening `PolyTimeReducible`.** Replacing its concrete TM2 obligation by
   a size bound changes the project's complexity model and invalidates the
   theorem statement.
5. **Unbounded input in finite control.** A label carrying `x`, a tableau row,
   or a runtime gate position cannot inhabit the finite control of `FinTM2`.
   Such data must live on bounded stacks or unary counters.
6. **Using only the existing quadratic macro.** A verifier witness may carry
   a polynomial of any fixed degree. One nested loop cannot justify the
   universal theorem. `PolyBuilder.Clock` closes this specific gap.
7. **Treating the clock as the circuit generator.** A long enough unit stream
   proves only that sufficient iterations exist; it does not compute gate tags,
   input-dependent boundary symbols, or unary predecessor indices.
8. **Relying on Lean/native evaluation as the machine.** Executability of the
   meta-level definition does not furnish the concrete `FinTM2.outputsFun`
   witness required by `TM2ComputableInPolyTime`.

## Focused Acceptance Mechanism

During generator development, use only dependency-scoped checks:

```text
lake build +CLRSLean.Chapter_34.Section_34_4_NP_Completeness_Proofs.PolyBuilder.Clock
lake env lean Tests/Chapter_34_PolyBuilder_Clock.lean
lake env lean Tests/Chapter_34_CookLevin_Interface.lean
python3 scripts/check_repository.py
git diff --check
```

The Cook--Levin interface is green only after all generator and
NP-completeness names above resolve. The final trust gate also prints axioms
for the generator computation theorem, the universal reduction, and
`generalCircuitSAT_npComplete`, and rejects `sorryAx` or project axioms. No
full-repository build belongs to this attack checkpoint.
